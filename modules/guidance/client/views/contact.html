        <h2>Feedback Instructions</h2>
        <p>The purpose of this website is to provide people with access to information and opportunities to participate in environmental assessments in British Columbia.</p>
        <p>In June 2016, the Environmental Assessment Office was proud to launch the first phase of a modernized version of its web-based information system: the EAO Project Information Centre (also known as “EPIC”).</p>
        <p>EPIC has been designed, built and implemented to improve the efficiency and transparency of the provincial environmental assessment process, and to provide citizens and stakeholders with more intuitive access to project data and information.</p>
        <p>It marks a substantial business and process change for all participants and stakeholders in the environmental assessment process, including project proponents, Aboriginal groups, working group members, and the public.</p>
        <p>The Environmental Assessment Office will continue making improvements to EPIC over time, so if you are interested in providing us with feedback about your experience in using this website, please feel free to send us your comments at: <a class="content-link" href="mailto:epicsupport.eao@gov.bc.ca">epicsupport.eao@gov.bc.ca</a>.</p>
